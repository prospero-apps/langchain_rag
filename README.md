# langchain_rag
A RAG example with PyPDFLoader

Data is retrieved from a PDF, in particular this magazine issue I once created:

<img width="632" height="822" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e441629-ed27-48cb-87c5-149470c658a6" />

And then, you can ask questions related to the contents of the issue.
